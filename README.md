Online chat is any direct text-, audio- or video-based , one-on-one or one-to-many ([group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room)) chat (formally also known as [synchronous conferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat)), using tools such as [instant messengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), talkers and possibly MUDs or other online games. Online chat includes web-based applications that allow communication – often directly addressed, but anonymous between users in a multi-user environment. [Web conferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing) is a more specific online service, that is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor. Online chat may address [point-to-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)) communications as well as [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast) communications from one sender to multiple receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web conferencing service.

Online chat in a narrower sense is any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a [real-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_text) transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as [Internet forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) and email. The expression online chat comes from the word chat which means "informal conversation".

# Connection:
network socket is a software structure within a [network node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) of a [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) that serves as an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network. The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (API) for the networking architecture. Sockets are created only during the lifetime of a process of an application running in the node.

Because of the [standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization) of the [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) protocols in the development of the Internet, the term network socket is most commonly used in the context of the Internet protocol suite, and is therefore often also referred to as Internet socket. In this context, a socket is externally identified to other hosts by its socket address, which is the triad of [transport protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer), IP address, and [port number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)#Port_number).

The term socket is also used for the software endpoint of node-internal inter-process communication ([IPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication)), which often uses the same API as a network socket.

# Socket addresses:
An application can communicate with a remote process by exchanging data with TCP/IP by knowing the combination of protocol type, IP address, and port number. This combination is often known as a socket address. It is the network-facing access handle to the network socket. The remote process establishes a network socket in its own instance of the protocol stack and uses the networking API to connect to the application, presenting its own socket address for use by the application.
